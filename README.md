# CodedCuts
Generative Papercutting Workshop at Make+Think+Code
April 27 & 28, 2019

A two-day workshop that looks at the history of paper-cutting craft and introduces new techniques involving generative processes. Students will first draw their own line art. Using this as a source, they will digitize their artwork to vector graphics and use custom software to generate a composition. With the help of laser cutting, students will assemble paper cuts that utilize layering and color play. This workshop provides an introduction to programming concepts through the medium of paper; no prior programming experience is necessary.

This is a repository of code samples and workshop applications that were made with Processing and openFrameworks.

### Processing Sketches 

Download Processing from https://processing.org/download/ to run the sketches.

#### Dependencies

The sketches require the following libraries in order to run:

[Control P5](https://github.com/sojamo/controlp5/releases/download/v2.2.5/controlP5-2.2.5.zip) (for creating user interface elements)

[Triangulate](http://n.clavaud.free.fr/processing/triangulate/triangulate-20100628.zip) (for Delaunay triangulation)

Unpack the zip files and place the contents in your Processing library folder.
Quit and restart Processing. See https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/How-to-Install-a-Contributed-Library for more info.
